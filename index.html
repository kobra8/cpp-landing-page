          <p class="text-justify">With the standardization of C++17, which happened officially in December 2017, we, as C++ developers, got many
            features to write better code.</p>
          <p class="text-justify">This book describes all significant changes in the language and the Standard Library. What's more, it provides
            a lot of practical examples so you can quickly apply the knowledge to your projects.</p>

    <h3 id="about-the-book" class="text-xs-center text-sm-center text-md-left text-lg-left">About the Book</h3>

    <p class="text-justify">The book has its roots in the long series of articles published at my site: bfilipek.com. I started discovering C++17
      a few months before it was officially published and I got more and more curious over the time. The content on the blog
      was growing, and I decided to make a single package of those articles.</p>

    <p>Making the book was not so easy, though!</p>

    <p class="text-justify">The initial compilation was quite weak, and I knew that to provide a valuable package for my readers I need to do more
      work. I rewrote each chapter of this book and reorganised them, so they contain the most relevant content. I’ve added
      tons of new code samples, with a better description and use cases.</p>

    <p>I believe this book might give you a solid start into C++17.</p>

    <p>Here are the features you’ll learn:</p>

    <p>Part One: C++17 Language features</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Fixes and depreciation</li>
      <li>Language clarification</li>
      <li>General language features</li>
      <li>Templates</li>
      <li>Attributes</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Part Two: C++17 The Standard Library</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <code>std::optional</code>
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>std::variant</code>
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>std::any</code>
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>std::string_view</code>
      </li>
      <li>String operations</li>
      <li>Filesystem</li>
      <li>Parallel STL</li>
      <li>Other Changes</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Part Three: More Examples and Use Cases</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Refactoring with
        <code>std::optional</code>
      </li>
      <li>Using
        <code>if constexpr</code>
      </li>
      <li>…</li>
      <li>and more planned</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The book contains now over 200 pages. I plan to rewrite a few more chapters and add some new pieces: especially with
      larger examples. The final version should have around 250 pages.</p>

    <p>Plans for the final version:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Add chapter about string operations</li>
      <li>Update chapter about Parallel STL</li>
      <li>Update and rewrite chapter about filesystem</li>
      <li>Add more examples to the third part.</li>
      <li>More polishing across the whole book</li>
    </ul>
