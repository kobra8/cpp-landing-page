          <p>With the standardization of C++17, which happened officially in December 2017, we, as C++ developers, got many features to write better code.</p>
          <p>This book describes all significant changes in the language and the Standard Library. What's more, it provides a lot of practical examples so you can quickly apply the knowledge to your projects.</p>          
          
          <h3 id="about-the-book">About the Book</h3>

<p>The book has its roots in the long series of articles published at my site: bfilipek.com. I started discovering C++17 a few months before it was officially published and I got more and more curious over the time. The content on the blog was growing, and I decided to make a single package of those articles.</p>

<p>Making the book was not so easy, though!</p>

<p>The initial compilation was quite weak, and I knew that to provide a valuable package for my readers I need to do more work. I rewrote each chapter of this book and reorganised them, so they contain the most relevant content. I’ve added tons of new code samples, with a better description and use cases.</p>

<p>I believe this book might give you a solid start into C++17.</p>

<p>Here are the features you’ll learn:</p>

<p>Part One: C++17 Language features</p>

<ul>
<li>Fixes and depreciation</li>
<li>Language clarification</li>
<li>General language features</li>
<li>Templates</li>
<li>Attributes</li>
</ul>

<p>Part Two: C++17 The Standard Library</p>

<ul>
<li><code>std::optional</code></li>
<li><code>std::variant</code></li>
<li><code>std::any</code></li>
<li><code>std::string_view</code></li>
<li>String operations</li>
<li>Filesystem</li>
<li>Parallel STL</li>
<li>Other Changes</li>
</ul>

<p>Part Three: More Examples and Use Cases</p>

<ul>
<li>Refactoring with <code>std::optional</code></li>
<li>Using <code>if constexpr</code></li>
<li>…</li>
<li>and more planned</li>
</ul>

<p>The book contains now over 200 pages. I plan to rewrite a few more chapters and add some new pieces: especially with larger examples. The final version should have around 250 pages.</p>

<p>Plans for the final version:</p>

<ul>
<li>Add chapter about string operations</li>
<li>Update chapter about Parallel STL</li>
<li>Update and rewrite chapter about filesystem</li>
<li>Add more examples to the third part.</li>
<li>More polishing across the whole book</li>
</ul>
